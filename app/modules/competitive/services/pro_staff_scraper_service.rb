# HTTP client for the ProStaff Scraper microservice.
#
# The scraper collects professional LoL match data from two sources:
#   - LoL Esports API (Phase 1 sync): schedules, team names, VOD IDs
#   - Leaguepedia Cargo API (Phase 2 enrichment): per-player stats
#     (champion, KDA, items, runes, summoner spells)
#
# Competitive games run on Riot's internal tournament servers and are NOT
# accessible via the public Match-V5 API. The scraper is the authoritative
# source for this data.
#
# Configuration (environment variables):
#   SCRAPER_API_URL  — base URL, e.g. https://scraper.prostaff.gg
#   SCRAPER_API_KEY  — key sent in X-API-Key header for write/status endpoints
#
# @example Fetch enriched CBLOL matches
#   service = ProStaffScraperService.new
#   result  = service.fetch_matches(league: 'CBLOL', limit: 20)
#   result[:matches] # => Array of match hashes
