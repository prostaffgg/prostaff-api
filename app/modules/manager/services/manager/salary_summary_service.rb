module Manager
  # Computes the current payroll summary for an organization.
  #
  # Reads from active contracts (not from player cache fields). All salary amounts
  # are normalized to a monthly equivalent before summing the total payroll.
  # weekly contracts are multiplied by 4; per_event contracts are excluded.
  #
  # @example
  #   Manager::SalarySummaryService.new(current_organization).call
  #   # => { total_monthly_payroll: 45000.0, player_count: 5, players: [...] }
